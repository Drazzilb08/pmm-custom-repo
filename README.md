So the way PMM is setup now I'm using a lot of the default builds. This is much easier for management and if any changes come down the pipe I'm not spending hours trying to figure out what all was added/changed.

Below you'll see my config file. I unlike most of you I have many different libraries splitting up my content.

Most of the changes that I've made have been due to me wanting to use custom posters to match the theme that I'm using. 

None of the posters are my original design. Movie posters are from MusikMann2000 from [ThePosterDB](http://theposterdb.com), other posters are from the official PMM poster repository [Here](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/tree/nightly/defaults/both)

If you want more information with regards to each of these settings please visit PMM's wiki [here](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/)
